# Security Analysis: Horizon Asset Listing Steward

## Executive Summary

The Horizon Asset Listing Steward implements a defense-in-depth security model for controlled asset listings in Aave V3 pools. This steward contract introduces multi-party governance controls, mandatory time delays, and conservative parameter validation to balance operational efficiency with protocol security.

**Key Security Features:**
- 24-hour proposal delay for community review
- Multi-party access controls (Risk Council + Guardian)
- Conservative parameter limits (max 75% LTV, 85% liquidation threshold)
- Emergency freeze/unfreeze capabilities
- Immutable contract design (no upgrade mechanisms)

## System Overview

The Asset Listing Steward operates as an intermediary layer between public asset listing proposals and the Aave V3 Config Engine, implementing governance controls that prevent unauthorized or malicious asset listings while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Threat Model

### 1. Privilege Escalation Attacks

**Threat**: Unauthorized actors attempting to gain steward permissions

**Attack Vectors**:
- Risk Council private key compromise
- Guardian private key compromise
- Contract upgrade attacks (if applicable)
- Social engineering targeting key holders

**Mitigations**:
- **Multi-party Control**: Separate Risk Council and Guardian roles
- **Function-specific Permissions**: Guardian can only cancel/freeze, not approve
- **Immutable Contracts**: No upgrade mechanisms in steward contracts
- **Key Management**: Recommend hardware wallets for privileged accounts

### 2. Malicious Asset Listing Attacks

**Threat**: Listing malicious or vulnerable assets

**Attack Vectors**:
- Fake token contracts with hidden backdoors
- Tokens with malicious transfer/approval logic
- Assets with centralized control risks
- Price manipulation through fake oracles

**Mitigations**:
- **24-hour Delay**: Time for community review of proposals
- **Parameter Validation**: Strict limits on risk parameters
- **Asset Validation**: Contract existence checks
- **Conservative Defaults**: 0% LTV, borrowing disabled initially
- **Risk Council Review**: Expert review before approval

### 3. Economic Attacks

**Threat**: Asset listings that could drain protocol funds

**Attack Vectors**:
- Assets with inflated valuations
- Correlated asset risks
- Liquidity manipulation
- Flash loan attacks on newly listed assets

**Mitigations**:
- **Supply Caps**: Hard limits on total asset exposure
- **Conservative Parameters**: Low initial LTV/liquidation thresholds
- **Gradual Activation**: Borrowing disabled initially
- **Oracle Requirements**: Reliable price feed validation

### 4. Governance Attacks

**Threat**: Manipulation of the steward governance process

**Attack Vectors**:
- Proposal spam/griefing
- Front-running of legitimate proposals
- Coordination attacks between multiple actors
- Denial of service on governance

**Mitigations**:
- **Proposal Limits**: One proposal per asset at a time
- **Cancellation Rights**: Multiple parties can cancel problematic proposals
- **Emergency Controls**: Guardian can freeze assets immediately
- **Transparent Process**: All actions emit events for monitoring

### 5. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities

**Threat**: Bugs in steward contract code

**Attack Vectors**:
- Reentrancy attacks
- Integer overflow/underflow
- Access control bypasses
- State inconsistencies

**Mitigations**:
- **Security Patterns**: Use of established OpenZeppelin contracts
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter checking
- **State Management**: Immutable critical parameters
- **Testing**: Extensive unit and integration tests

## Security Properties

### P1. Access Control Verification ✔️
**Property**: Only Risk Council can approve asset listings after the mandatory delay period.
```solidity
function approveAssetListing(uint256 proposalId) external override onlyRiskCouncil {
    require(block.timestamp >= proposal.proposedAt + PROPOSAL_DELAY, "PROPOSAL_DELAY_NOT_MET");
    // ... execution logic
}
```
**Status**: ✔️ Verified through unit tests and access control modifiers

### P2. Parameter Bounds Enforcement ✔️
**Property**: All risk parameters must respect maximum thresholds to prevent excessive risk exposure.
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_LTV = 75_00;                    // 75%
uint256 public constant MAX_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD = 85_00;  // 85%
require(listing.ltv <= MAX_LTV, "INVALID_LTV");
require(listing.liqThreshold <= MAX_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD, "INVALID_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD");
```
**Status**: ✔️ Verified through parameter validation tests

### P3. Proposal Delay Invariant ✔️
**Property**: No proposal can be executed before the mandatory 24-hour delay period.
```solidity
uint256 public constant PROPOSAL_DELAY = 24 hours;
require(block.timestamp >= proposal.proposedAt + PROPOSAL_DELAY, "PROPOSAL_DELAY_NOT_MET");
```
**Status**: ✔️ Verified through time-based testing scenarios

### P4. Emergency Response Capability ✔️
**Property**: Guardian can immediately freeze assets without delay for emergency response.
```solidity
function emergencyFreezeAsset(address asset) external override onlyRiskCouncilOrGuardian {
    configurator.setReserveFreeze(asset, true);
}
```
**Status**: ✔️ Verified through emergency procedure tests

### P5. Multi-Party Cancellation Rights ✔️
**Property**: Proposals can be cancelled by proposer, Risk Council, or Guardian before execution.
```solidity
require(
    msg.sender == proposal.proposer || 
    msg.sender == RISK_COUNCIL || 
    msg.sender == GUARDIAN,
    "INVALID_CALLER"
);
```
**Status**: ✔️ Verified through multi-party cancellation tests

## Parameter Security

### Security Constants
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_LTV = 75_00;                    // 75% - Maximum loan-to-value ratio
uint256 public constant MAX_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD = 85_00;  // 85% - Maximum liquidation threshold  
uint256 public constant PROPOSAL_DELAY = 24 hours;         // 24 hours - Mandatory review period
uint256 public constant MAX_CAP_INCREASE = 100_00;         // 100% - Maximum cap increase per update
```

**Security Rationale**:
- **MAX_LTV (75%)**: Prevents over-leveraging while maintaining competitive lending ratios. Based on historical volatility analysis of crypto assets.
- **MAX_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD (85%)**: Provides 10% minimum buffer above LTV for liquidation safety margin during market volatility.
- **PROPOSAL_DELAY (24 hours)**: Allows sufficient time for community review, emergency response, and threat detection while maintaining operational efficiency.
- **MAX_CAP_INCREASE (100%)**: Prevents dramatic exposure increases that could destabilize the protocol.

### Conservative Defaults
```solidity
// Initial listing parameters (from AssetListingSteward tests)
ltv: 0,                          // No borrowing against asset initially
liqThreshold: 0,                 // No liquidation risk initially
enabledToBorrow: DISABLED,       // Cannot borrow asset initially
supplyCap: 1000000,             // Limited exposure
borrowCap: 0,                   // No borrowing initially
```

**Rationale**:
- **Zero Risk Start**: New assets pose no immediate risk to protocol
- **Gradual Activation**: Parameters can be increased over time with observation
- **Supply Caps**: Limit maximum protocol exposure to new assets

## Emergency Procedures

### Immediate Response (Guardian)
1. **Asset Freeze**: `emergencyFreezeAsset(asset)`
   - Immediately stops all operations for an asset
   - Prevents further deposits/withdrawals
   - Protects protocol from ongoing attacks

2. **Proposal Cancellation**: `cancelAssetListing(proposalId)`
   - Stops malicious proposals before execution
   - Can be done by proposer, Risk Council, or Guardian

### Controlled Response (Risk Council)
1. **Asset Unfreeze**: `emergencyUnfreezeAsset(asset)`
   - Restores normal operations after threat resolution
   - Requires Risk Council approval (not Guardian)

2. **Parameter Updates**: `updateRiskParameters(updates)`
   - Adjust risk parameters for existing assets
   - Can reduce exposure to problematic assets

### Escalation Procedures
1. **Immediate**: Guardian freezes asset
2. **Analysis**: Risk Council investigates the threat
3. **Resolution**: Risk Council unfreezes or adjusts parameters
4. **Documentation**: Post-incident analysis and improvements
