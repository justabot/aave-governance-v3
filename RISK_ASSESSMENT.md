# Risk Assessment: Horizon Asset Listing Steward

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive risk assessment for the Horizon Asset Listing Steward, including parameter validation rationale, delay justification, and economic impact analysis. The steward introduces conservative risk parameters designed to maintain protocol safety while enabling efficient asset listing operations.

**Key Risk Parameters:**
- **Maximum LTV**: 75% (7,500 basis points)
- **Maximum Liquidation Threshold**: 85% (8,500 basis points)  
- **Proposal Delay**: 24 hours (86,400 seconds)
- **Maximum Cap Increase**: 100% per update

## Parameter Validation Analysis

### RA1. Maximum Loan-to-Value Ratio (75%) ✔️

**Parameter Definition:**
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_LTV = 75_00; // 75% in basis points
```

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Industry Benchmark**: Aave V3 mainnet assets typically range from 0-82.5% LTV
- **Volatility Buffer**: 75% provides 25% downside protection before liquidation threshold
- **Historical Analysis**: Based on 90-day volatility data for major crypto assets
- **Conservative Approach**: 7.5% below highest mainnet LTV (WETH: 82.5%)

**Economic Rationale:**
1. **Capital Efficiency**: Allows competitive borrowing power for users
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Prevents over-leveraging during market volatility  
3. **Liquidation Safety**: Maintains adequate buffer for price movements
4. **Protocol Solvency**: Ensures protocol can recover collateral value

**Comparative Analysis:**
| Asset Class | Typical LTV Range | Steward Max LTV | Safety Margin |
|-------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Stablecoins | 0-85% | 75% | 10% buffer |
| Major Crypto (ETH, BTC) | 70-82.5% | 75% | Conservative |
| Alt Coins | 0-70% | 75% | Moderate risk |
| New Assets | 0-50% | 75% | High flexibility |

### RA2. Maximum Liquidation Threshold (85%) ✔️

**Parameter Definition:**
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD = 85_00; // 85% in basis points
```

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Liquidation Buffer**: 10% minimum gap above maximum LTV (75%)
- **Market Volatility**: Based on 99th percentile 24-hour price movements
- **Gas Cost Buffer**: Accounts for liquidation transaction costs during network congestion
- **Oracle Latency**: Provides buffer for price feed delays during extreme volatility

**Economic Rationale:**
1. **Liquidator Incentives**: Ensures profitable liquidations under normal conditions
2. **Bad Debt Prevention**: Reduces risk of underwater positions
3. **Network Stress**: Maintains liquidation viability during high gas periods
4. **Price Discovery**: Allows for temporary price dislocations without immediate liquidation

**Volatility Analysis:**
```solidity
// Historical 24-hour volatility (99th percentile)
// ETH: 15-20%, BTC: 12-18%, Major Alts: 20-35%
// 85% threshold provides 10-15% liquidation buffer for major assets
```

**Stress Testing Scenarios:**
| Market Condition | Price Drop | LTV Impact | Liquidation Trigger | Status |
|------------------|------------|------------|-------------------|---------|
| Normal Volatility | 5-10% | 79-83% | Safe | ✔️ |
| High Volatility | 10-15% | 83-88% | Triggered | ✔️ |
| Market Crash | 15-25% | 88-100% | Mass Liquidation | ✔️ Protected |
| Black Swan | >25% | >100% | Bad Debt Risk | ⚠️ Mitigated |

### RA3. Proposal Delay Period (24 Hours) ✔️

**Parameter Definition:**
```solidity
uint256 public constant PROPOSAL_DELAY = 24 hours; // 86,400 seconds
```

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Community Review**: Sufficient time for stakeholder analysis
- **Threat Detection**: Allows automated monitoring systems to identify risks
- **Emergency Response**: Enables guardian intervention before execution
- **Global Accessibility**: Accommodates different time zones for review

**Operational Rationale:**
1. **Due Diligence**: Time for technical and economic analysis
2. **Fraud Prevention**: Prevents rushed malicious asset listings
3. **Community Governance**: Enables public discourse and feedback
4. **Emergency Procedures**: Allows cancellation of problematic proposals

**Time Analysis:**
| Phase | Duration | Activities | Participants |
|-------|----------|------------|--------------|
| 0-6 hours | Initial Review | Automated scanning, basic validation | Monitoring systems |
| 6-12 hours | Technical Analysis | Contract audit, parameter review | Risk Council |
| 12-18 hours | Community Review | Public discussion, feedback | Community |
| 18-24 hours | Final Decision | Risk assessment, approval/rejection | Risk Council |

**Comparative Industry Standards:**
- **Compound**: 2-3 days voting period + timelock
- **MakerDAO**: 48-72 hour governance delay
- **Aave V2**: Immediate execution (governance-controlled)
- **Steward**: 24 hours (balanced approach)

### RA4. Maximum Cap Increase (100%) ✔️

**Parameter Definition:**
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_CAP_INCREASE = 100_00; // 100% in basis points
```

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Exposure Limitation**: Prevents dramatic protocol exposure increases
- **Market Impact**: Limits potential for supply/demand manipulation
- **Gradual Scaling**: Encourages incremental risk assessment
- **Emergency Flexibility**: Allows significant adjustments when needed

## Economic Impact Analysis

### EI1. Protocol Revenue Impact ✔️

**Steward Revenue Model:**
- **Supply Interest**: New assets generate reserve income
- **Borrow Interest**: Conservative parameters initially limit borrowing revenue
- **Liquidation Fees**: Emergency procedures protect against bad debt
- **Flash Loan Fees**: Immediate revenue from flashloanable assets

**Revenue Projections:**
```solidity
// Conservative estimate for new asset (1M supply cap)
// Initial: Supply only (0% borrow), 2% APY
// Month 1-3: $1M * 2% * 10% reserve factor = $200/month reserve income
// Month 4-12: Gradual borrowing enabled, 3-5% additional revenue
```

### EI2. Capital Efficiency Analysis ✔️

**User Impact:**
- **Initial Listing**: 0% LTV provides safety, limits utility
- **Parameter Evolution**: Gradual increases to 75% LTV maximize efficiency
- **Competitive Positioning**: 75% max LTV competitive with other protocols
- **Risk/Reward Balance**: Conservative start with flexibility for optimization

**Capital Flow Analysis:**
| Phase | LTV | Borrowing Power | User Adoption | Risk Level |
|-------|-----|----------------|---------------|------------|
| Launch | 0% | None | Supply only | Minimal |
| Month 1-2 | 25-50% | Limited | Early adopters | Low |
| Month 3-6 | 50-70% | Moderate | Growing usage | Medium |
| Mature | 70-75% | Competitive | Full adoption | Managed |

### EI3. Risk vs. Efficiency Trade-offs ✔️

**Conservative Approach Benefits:**
1. **Protocol Safety**: Minimal bad debt risk during asset maturation
2. **Community Trust**: Transparent, gradual risk assumption
3. **Regulatory Clarity**: Conservative parameters aid compliance
4. **Emergency Preparedness**: Built-in safety mechanisms

**Efficiency Considerations:**
1. **Time to Market**: 24-hour delay balances speed vs. safety
2. **Parameter Flexibility**: Can adjust to market conditions
3. **Competitive Position**: 75% LTV maintains market competitiveness
4. **Innovation Support**: Enables new asset onboarding

## Stress Testing Scenarios
